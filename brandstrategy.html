<p id="p1">Brand strategy is part of a business plan that outlines how the company will build rapport and favorability within the market. The goal of a brand strategy is to become memorable in the eyes of the consumer so that they decide to patronize your business over the competition.A well-defined and executed brand strategy affects all aspects of a business and is directly connected to consumer needs, emotions, and competitive environments.

First, let's clear up the biggest misconception about brand strategy: Your brand is not solely your product, your logo, your website, or your name.

Your brand is all of that and more — it's the stuff that feels intangible. Your brand is that hard-to-pin-down feeling that separates powerhouse brands from forgettable brands.

To objectively understand a subjective matter that many marketers consider more of an art and less of a science, we've broken down seven essential components of a comprehensive brand strategy that will help keep your company relevant for decades.</p>
<h1 id="element" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="2000">Elements of a Brand Strategy</h1>
<img id="brandpic" src="pic.png" data-aos="zoom-in">
<h3>1.Purpose:</h3>
<p id="p2">While understanding what your business promises is necessary when defining your brand positioning, knowing why you wake up every day and go to work carries more weight. In other words, your purpose is more specific in that it serves as a differentiator between you and your competitors.</p>
<h3>2.Consistency:</h3>
<p id="p2">The key to consistency is to avoid talking about things that don’t relate to or enhance your brand.
Added a new photo to your business’s Facebook Page? What does it mean for your company? Does it align with your message, or was it just something funny that would, quite frankly, confuse your audience?
To give your brand a platform to stand on, you need to ensure your messaging is cohesive. Ultimately, consistency contributes to brand recognition, which fuels customer loyalty.
</br></br>To avoid leaving potential customers struggling to put the disconnected pieces of your business together, consider the benefits of creating a style guide. A style guide can encompass everything from the tone of voice you'll use to the color scheme you'll employ to the way you'll position certain products or services.</p>

<h3>3.Emotions:</h3>
<p id="p2">Customers aren't always rational.

How else do you explain the person who paid thousands of dollars more for a Harley rather than buying another cheaper, equally well-made bike? There was an emotional voice in there somewhere, whispering: “Buy a Harley.”
</br></br>
But why?
</br></br>
Harley Davidson uses emotional branding by creating a community around its brand. It began HOG—Harley Owners Group—to connect their customers with their brandBy providing customers with an opportunity to feel like they're part of a larger group that's more tight-knit than just a bunch of motorcycle riders, Harley Davidson is able to position themselves as an obvious choice for someone looking to purchase a bike.</p>

<h3>4.Flexibility:</h3>
<p id="p2">In this fast-changing world, marketers must remain flexible to stay relevant. On the plus side, this frees you to be creative with your campaigns.consistency aims to set the standard for your brand, flexibility enables you to make adjustments that build interest and distinguish your approach from your competition.
</br></br>If your old tactics aren’t working anymore, don’t be afraid to change. Just because it worked in the past doesn't mean it's working now.

Take the opportunity to engage your followers in fresh, new ways. Are there some out-of-the-box partnerships your brand can make? Are there attributes about your product you never highlighted? Use those to connect with new customers and remind your old ones why they love you.</p>

<h3>5.Employee Involvement</h3>
<p id="p2">As we mentioned before, achieving a sense of consistency is vital if you wish to build brand recognition. And while a style guide can help you achieve a cohesive digital experience, it's equally essential for your employees to be well-versed in communicating with customers and representing the brand.
</br></br>
If your brand is playful and bubbly through Twitter engagements, it won’t make sense if a customer called in and was connected with a grumpy, monotone representative, right?</p>

<h3>6.Loyalty</h3>
<p id="p2">If you already have people that love you, your company, and your brand, don’t just sit there — reward them for that love.These customers have gone out of their way to write about you, tell their friends about you, and act as your brand ambassadors.Cultivating loyalty from these people early on will yield more returning customers — and more profit for your business.Sometimes, just a thank you is all that's needed. Other times, it's better to go above and beyond. Write them a personalized letter. Send them some special swag. Ask them to write a review and feature them prominently on your website.</br></br>Loyalty is a critical part of every brand strategy, especially to support your sales organization. Highlighting a positive relationship between you and your existing customers sets the tone for what potential customers can expect if they choose to do business with you.</p>

<h3>7.Competitive Awareness</h3>
<p id="p2">Take the competition as a challenge to improve your own strategy and create greater value in your overall brand. You are in the same business and going after the same customers, right? So watch what they do.Do some of their tactics succeed? Do some fail? Tailor your brand positioning based on their experience to better your company.</br></br>While staying in tune with your competitor's strategies is essential if you want to enhance your brand, don't let them dictate every move you make.Sure, you probably sell a similar product or service as many other companies, but you're in business because your brand is unique. By harping on every move your competitor makes, you lose that differentiation.</p>
