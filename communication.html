<h1 data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="2000">What Is Brand Communication?</h1>
<p data-aos="flip-left" data-aos-duration="2000">Your customers and stakeholders are the ones who ultimately determine whether they will accept or reject your brand image.
</br></br>
You as a company need to implement a brand communication strategy in order to persuade and influence your stakeholders to look at you in a certain way.</p>

<h1 data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="2000">Advantages Of Brand Communication</h1>
<p data-aos="flip-left" data-aos-duration="2000">A successful brand communication strategy will reap heavy rewards.
</br></br>
Whether you’re a small, local business or a large, multi-national corporation, it can be the aspect of your business that catapults you to the next level.</p>

<h1 data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="2000">1.Creates A Relationship With Your Audience</h1>
<p data-aos="flip-left" data-aos-duration="2000">Communicating your brand in a meaningful way will create a trusting relationship with your audience.
</br></br>
Consumers buy from who they know and who they trust.
</br></br>
If you can create this relationship in a way that you audience resonates with, it will convert loyal customers over the long run.</p>


<h1 data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="2000">2.Differentiates Your Company</h1>
<p data-aos="flip-left" data-aos-duration="2000">The more that you can differentiate your company in the marketplace, the better.
</br></br>
One way large corporations do this is through branding.
</br></br>
You may have similar products and similar prices to your competitors, but what they can never truly mimic is your brand image.
</br></br>
Creating a unique brand image is therefore critical to long term business success.</p>

<h1 data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="2000">3.Gives Multiple Reasons For Consumers To Buy</h1>
<p data-aos="flip-left" data-aos-duration="2000">A successful brand will communicate many different qualities of their business to their customers.
</br></br>
It can let customers know that you are environmentally friendly, family-oriented, health-conscious, financially-minded – the list goes on and on.
</br></br>
Having a brand that communicates all of these important aspects to your customers will give them many reasons to buy from you.</p>

<h1>How To Create A Successful Brand Communication Strategy</h1>
<p data-aos="flip-left" data-aos-duration="2000">A brand communication strategy comes in many moving parts.
</br></br>
It is your job to put all of the individual pieces together to create a seamless brand image to project to your customers.</p>

<h1 data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="2000">1.Customer Avatar</h1>
<p data-aos="flip-left" data-aos-duration="2000">Creating a customer avatar is one the most important things you can do when initially creating and setting up your brand strategy.
</br></br>
Who are you marketing to?
</br></br>
That is what the customer avatar answers.
</br></br>
It is essentially the specific characteristics of your perfect, ideal customer.
</br></br>
When creating your messaging, marketing and branding, it should speak exactly to who this person is – AKA your customer avatar.</p>

<h1 data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="2000">2.Core Message</h1>
<p data-aos="flip-left" data-aos-duration="2000">Now that you know your customer avatar, how can you formulate a message that will speak directly to them?
</br></br>
What do they resonate with?
</br></br>
What will they respond to?
</br></br>
Any great marketer and brand strategist know what buttons to press and levels to pull to get a positive and actionable response from their ideal customer.
</br></br>
Create your messaging around this person and speak directly to them in all of your marketing material.</p>


<h1 data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="2000">3. Unique Value Proposition (USP)</h1>
<p data-aos="flip-left" data-aos-duration="2000">You also need to understand what benefits you have to offer your consumers, what makes you unique in the market, and why your ideal customers should buy from you.
</br></br>
What value are you giving them in return for their money?
</br></br>
This needs to be crystal clear – as the value you communicate to them should far exceed the price you asking them to pay for it.</p>

<h1 data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="2000">4.Marketing Mix</h1>
<p data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-duration="2000">Next, you must understand how you will communicate with your customers.
</br></br>
This comes down to the 4 P’s of marketing: price, product, place, and promotion.</br></br>
<b>i.Price</b></br>
The price point that you are selling your products and services at.
</br></br>
<b>ii.Product</b></br>
The product or service you are offering to your customers.
</br></br>
<b>iii.Place</b></br>
As the saying goes: “location, location, location!”
</br></br>
Define the point of sale in which you will be selling your products.
</br></br>
Is it in store, online, or both?
</br></br>
<b>iv.Promotion</b></br>
The exact marketing activities you will engage in to sell your product.
</br></br>
This includes methods of advertising, deals and discounts, contests and prizes, and more.</p>

<h1 data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="2000">5. Brand Personality</h1>
<p data-aos="flip-left" data-aos-duration="2000">
Define the personality you would like to portray for your brand.
</br></br>
It should be memorable and something in the realm of which your ideal customer will remember.
</br></br>
A good example of this is Old Spice.
</br></br>
They’re known for their funny and over-the-top manly commercials.
</br></br>
Because of it, consumers remember their brand and their products.
</br></br>
Try to emulate and illicit a similar response from your own target customers.</p>
